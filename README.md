# image-tidier
A simple Python script to help me in organizing image collections.
Works by sifting through images in a directory, calculating a hash for each image, then comparing each image's hash to each other.
Matplotlib allows for similar images to be shown, and for the user to decided whether they are similar or not, and given by the users input whether the script will delete the extra image.
